FLOW.CouchDB - first prototype
====================================

##Description:
CouchDB Driver developed for TYPO3 FLOW. 

Coded for current Git version (i guess it's somewhere between 1.1 oder 1.2). 
Remember, unless it's not a finished and full-tested driver, never use this productive! 

##Features:
- Connecting to CouchDB Server
- Select a database
- View all documents
- Create, Update, Delete (CRUD) Documents



##Installation:
Clone into Application folder of your TYPO3 Flow Framework. 
Activate it manually using "PackageStates.php". 

Feel free to include the driver in your own controllers.
